\arguments{
\item{ylist}{Data.}

\item{countslist}{Counts corresponding to multiplicities.}

\item{x}{Times, if points are not evenly spaced. Defaults to NULL, in which
case the value becomes \code{1:T}, for the $T==length(ylist)$.}

\item{destin}{Directory where output files are saved.}

\item{lambda_means}{Regularization parameters for means.}

\item{lambda_probs}{Regularization parameters for probs.}

\item{l}{Degree of differencing for the mean trend filtering. l=0 will give
you piecewise constant means; l=1 is piecewise linear, and so forth.}

\item{l_prob}{Degree of differencing for the probability trend filtering.}

\item{maxdev}{Maximum deviation of cluster means across time..}

\item{numclust}{Number of clusters.}

\item{nfold}{Number of cross-validation folds. Defaults to 5.}

\item{blocksize}{Contiguous time blocks from which to form CV time folds.}

\item{nrestart}{Number of repetitions.}

\item{verbose}{Loud or not? EM iteration progress is printed.}

\item{refit}{If TRUE, estimate the model on the full data, for each pair of
regularization parameters.}

\item{save_meta}{If TRUE, save meta data.}

\item{mc.cores}{Use this many CPU cores.}

\item{folds}{Manually provide CV folds (list of time points of data to use
as CV folds). Defaults to NULL.}

\item{niter}{Maximum number of EM iterations.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to flowtrend().}
}
\value{
No return.
